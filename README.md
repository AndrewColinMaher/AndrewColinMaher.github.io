# Online Portfolio for Cillian Maher

## CJBlasts

This project is an online portfolio I created for my son Cillian Maher who is an aspiring and budding youtuber that provides content such as animation shorts on his channel.
He has requested myself to give him an online presence.
This project is also a Milestone one project which is to be a static front end website built by using html css and front end technologies I have learnt while studying Software Development at the Code Insititue.

This project will contain a homepage with navigational links to other pages of the site which will inculde a art page that will shocase his upcoming artwork, a video gallery page to shocase his video's past and upcoming works a contact page where users can get in touch and also a link where the client sells his own merchandise.

## UX

### Market Analysis

The Primary and secondary target audience users of this site are in the age group of 10 years old an on upards to 30
or more. I will be designing the site to be simple and attractive to its users, I will be using bright colours and animating svg images to make the site feel fun and interactive these could be children or young adults that came to the site from
twitter, discord, reddit or even youtube.

### Features

The site needs to be colourful and simplistic that evokes warmth anf fun. It should have some moving or animating features so I will be looking closley at css
animations with tools such as Keyframes chrome tool to help me animate images and divs.

This site is going to be fully responsive across desktop tablet and mobile devices. It will use a flex Grid to display art work and a video gallery which uses modals that incorporate a footer with links to the clients social media accounts
when displaying videos.

This site should have a messeage me contact form.

- Best Practices, had hightlighted that Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe and that Adding rel="noopener" or rel="noreferrer" to all exteral links
  to impove serurty vulnerabilities and pissible perfomrmance issues

- And to use rel="preload" in my Head links to sprecify its importance and level up its load times.
