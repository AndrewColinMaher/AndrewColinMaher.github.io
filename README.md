## CJBlasts

This project is an online portfolio I have created for my son Cillian Maher, who is an aspiring and budding youtuber  providing content such as animation shorts on his channel.
He has requested myself to give him an online presence.
This project is also a Milestone one project, which is to be a static front end website built by using html, css and front end technologies I have learned while studying Software Development at the Code Insititue.

This project will contain a homepage with navigational links to other pages of the site which will include an art page that will showcase his upcoming artwork, a video gallery page to showcase his video's past and upcoming works and a contact page where users can get in touch, and also a link where the client sells his own merchandise.

## UX

### Market Analysis

The Primary and secondary target audience users of this site are in the age group of 10 years old and upwards to 30
or more. I will be designing the site to be simple and attractive to its users, I will be using bright colours and animating svg images to make the site feel fun and interactive, these could be children or young adults that came to the site from
twitter, discord, reddit or even youtube.

### Features

The site needs to be colourful and simplistic so that it evokes warmth and fun. It should have some moving or animating features, css
animations with tools such as Keyframes chrome tool to help me animate images and divs.

This site is going to be fully responsive across desktop tablet and mobile devices. It will use a flex Grid to display art work and a video gallery which uses modals that incorporate a footer with links to the clients social media accounts
when displaying videos.

- The Video Gallery will use modals that have a footer which will contain links to Cj's social media

- This site will have a link to an external site where he sells his merchandise.

- This site will have a messeage me contact form.

### Upcoming Features

The site will have a broader Social section that showcases collaborators with works and inspiration.

### Upcoming Updates - end Jan

## Design and Process

- #### Using these colours and experimenting with various split complementary and triad choices using [adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/)

 #### Colours
![4c2432cf5771299900eafca4a6f77a26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26776439/102649277-cacc8900-4160-11eb-98d7-752230d5006c.png)

Changes to the Navbar, these screenshots are examples of the Sites main navigation but it took up to much of the sites real estate expecially on [mobile](https://ibb.co/Z6yCxQh)

![oldnavbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26776439/99538453-e6e3db80-29a4-11eb-93c0-c4fd68d59e3c.png)

Here I eventually settled on moving the navbar into my top banner, to save on valuable space on the website. Also I eventually got my brand and merch links to float left and right with my remaining links centered.
![new navbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26776439/99538043-51e0e280-29a4-11eb-95c2-1ab22561572f.png)

To make my links more fun and attractive I used [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) as this had plenty of options to make links and icons move or do something when hovered over or clicked. I liked to use hover pulse and hover grow on suitable elements.

#### Media

The CJ figure on the home page and contact page was drawn by myself, they are based upon CJblasts avatar, all other images and videos are created by Cillian Maher.

On the home page and contact page I added interactivity with the SVG images, on the home page I made the sunshades drop onto the Avatar and on the contact page I made his avatar slide into view from the left.

#### Typography

My client cjblasts had requested me to use [Molot](https://www.dafont.com/molot.font) mostly for titles as this is what he uses on his content.
[Helvetica](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/) has been used in conjuntcion with Molot for I thought it gave better visual flow than Roboto and other contenders.<br />
[Sniglet](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sniglet?selection.family=Roboto&sidebar.open=true) I used to the more personal type on the site as this has a youthful friendly appearence and so I thought it would work good with my target audience.

    - Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.

## Testing

 I used **[W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)** and **[W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/)** to check the validity of the website code.

 I used [ScreenFly](https://screenfly.org/) to test the website on different screen sizes and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) for improving the performance and acessibiltiy for the site.

This site was tested on mutliple browsers and works well on **Chrome** **Firefox** and **Opera**.
- Internet explorer and samsung internet ar not displaying some colours correctly, I will be adding appriopiate vender prefixes or modifying my filters to fix this in the next updates.

The Client and user stories achieved the outcome of providing them with  an easy to navigate site that was simplistic
and colourful that proved appealing to the clients peers. 

Users can find links to the clients social media throughout the site, on Home page there is a section below the above fold that has large
icons linking users to the clients Social Media account. The icons have a fun hover pulse that adds to the interactive animnation theme for the site.

They have also links to the clients social media in the footer of every page on the site. The Gallery has video modals that open the clients animation shorts
on each video has its own modal footer with social media icons too that appear fun and interactive.

After recieving feedback from clients friends and peers who tested the site, I changed the colours to have a better warmer contrast and improved readability for the site. A suggestion of having
the arrow pointers from the speech bubble change direction when on desktop was suggested, I accompleshed this with some CSS code.

I successfully added the clients online merch store to the site and it is accessible on the navbar and footer of every page> Each link has been given a "target="blank" code so as to open on a new page.

Users that want to see who else the client does animation for  can do so on the gallery page. The contact form currently is only set up for the front end but will be up and running
when I am learning about forms and back end in my course.

### Further Testing
Shared with fellow students for a peer review of the site, the modal positioning was shown to be problematic, 
I targeted the modal class in css and this fixed the issue on large screen and mobile screens.
### Known Bugs
The position of the video modals on mobile screens was sometimes getting fixed to top of the screen out of view to the viewer if the viewer had scrolled up or down.
I have added "modal-dialog-centered" and targeted modal on css and this has fixed the issus on a lot of screen sizes but was still buggy on chrome mobile,
eventually I added a centered fixed position to .modal-open and this has eventually fixed the positioning of the modals but now when the
modal opens the website background turns white.
